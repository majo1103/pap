This is simple voting app.

To run the backend application please start the server in public directory.

You will probably need to modify the Config file before running the command:
php -S localhost:8000

After starting the server as described above, you will have REST api
http://localhost:8000/polls/1

Not yet implemented functionality is marked with //TODO

This version is very limited, as it is not using REST-API frameworks, and every URL had to be matched agains RegEx, in the new version I plan to use Directus for generating API.
